# Closures
Bryan gave an excellent talk about closures. He described all of the different ways to declare a closure (with variables, without variables, as a trailing closure, and more!), how to assign it to a variable, and how to use it. He also covered how we can make our closures more concise and/or more readable. Bryan explained the power of being able to pre-declare your closures, so that you can pass it to a closure or a function in order to get a result.

Bryan also introduced us to `filter`, `map`, and `reduce` -- common powerful functions provided by apple, that take closures, to help interact with our objects that adhere to the `Collection` type.

Bryan taught us about how to play Cee-lo, while showing us examples of closures, as he live coded a small app. He showed us how closures can take closures in order to in order to share variables and execute code.

We then discussed the difference between `@escaping` and `@non-escaping` closures and how they're commonly used in networking code.

If you found any of the synopsis confusing, please check out the playground he used for demonstration. If you can't remember what the syntax was for your favorite closure, you can always check out http://goshdarnclosuresyntax.com/ to see the syntax in common use cases.
